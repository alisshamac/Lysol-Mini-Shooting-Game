# Lysol â€“ Mini Shooting Game

Lysol is a 2D mini shooting game developed in Java, inspired by arcade-style shooters like EveryWing. In this germ-fighting game, players control a can of Lysol spray tasked with disinfecting waves of invading microbes in a timed battle for survival.
## Gameplay Overview

1. Play as a Lysol Spray Can
   Use the arrow keys to move and press the space bar to shoot disinfectant sprays upward and eliminate germs.

2. Enemy Waves
   Standard germs enter from the right side of the screen and must be sprayed away before they reach the player.

4. Power-Ups

   Pills and Tablets fall during gameplay and act as power-ups, increasing fire rate, damage, or temporarily shielding the player.

5. Boss Fight: The Virus
   A powerful Virus Boss appears during the game. It has significantly more HP and is much larger than regular germs, adding challenge and intensity to the match.

6. Timed Survival
   Players must survive for a set amount of time. The final score is based on how many germs are eliminated before the timer runs out.
